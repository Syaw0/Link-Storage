### Link-Storage

---


##### why this project exist?

Linkstore is not a special app.  
In fact, it is like a big warehouse just to organize and base your links, 
although as a software it is still not complete and it has problems,
for example, using local storage as data storage is one of these problems. 
My goal is to make Jason App more alive by starting my studies on back-end science
and writing projects with the help of my apis and a low-level json database...
